# arcfourLibC
Introduction
This repository provides a clean, minimalistic implementation of the ARCFOUR (RC4) encryption algorithm. ARCFOUR is a stream cipher known for its simplicity and speed, commonly used for secure communication and data protection. This library aims to deliver an easy-to-use interface while adhering to cryptographic best practices where applicable.

Note: While ARCFOUR is historically significant, it is no longer recommended for modern cryptographic use due to vulnerabilities in its key scheduling algorithm (KSA). This library is intended for educational purposes or legacy system compatibility.

ðŸŒŸ Features
.Lightweight Implementation: Minimal dependencies and straightforward design.
.High Performance: Optimized for speed and efficiency.
.Stream Cipher Functionality: Supports encryption and decryption of byte streams.

ðŸš§ Project Status
This project is under development. Features and APIs may change as the library evolves. Contributions, suggestions, and feedback are welcome!
